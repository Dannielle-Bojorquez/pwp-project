## Milestone 1 Feedback
Overall nice work on your Milestone 1. Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal are well defined, your project is set up according to spec, and your HTML is looking great. I do see opportunity for additional refinement in regards to specifics of your purpose, audience and goal however. You specifically mention Front End, but what kinds of opportunites would you like to target specifically?

If working with small businesses and doing digital marketing is your focus, then perhaps gearing the site more for potential contract clients might be the way to go. And even then there's still more room for specifics regarding what industry: food/hospitality, entertainment/arts, health/beauty, light/heavy manufacturing, etc. Or, let's say as a Front End developer you're interested in cutting-edge data visualization or animation, then perhaps targeting firms that work with creative industries or data modeling would be the way to go. 

So what kind of web development would you like to do? What kinds of companies or clients would you like to work for? Do you plan to focus more on freelance contracts or employment opportunities? It's totally OK if you don't know the answers to these questions right now, but these may be useful ideas and questions to keep in mind going forward.

Your Persona and Use Case are thoughtfully outlined, but my advice above applies here as well. I think Lawrence sounds more like a potential contract client than someone looking to hire in-house IT staff directly given that he runs a small maintenance shop and is probably not managing an internal IT or Marketing Dept. It also sounds like he's looking more for a "Digital Marketing" person than a front-end web developer actually. I point these things out only to help draw attention to important points of distinction regarding how you might plan to position and market yourself on your site.

There's nothing wrong with creating a "general purpose" portfolio - but I do believe it's important to think about what kinds of opportunities you're really interested in. Daniel Heron can really help with this too, and he's full of good advice. TL; DR... what kind of work do YOU REALLY want to do in a year's time? :D

Again, great job on setting up the repository to spec and coding up your document - this level of attention to detail is important! Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on Milestone 2a.

- I'd remove the `<p>` tag on line 21. It's an "orphan".

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Yes, this is much better! What you've created here provides you with a much better road map for your development. This layout design can be clearly translated into HTML, CSS and Bootstrap classes... I can see the containers, sections, rows, columns, etc. This will definitely help your development.

Be very careful with your navbar on mobile... horizontal space can be pretty tight on smaller mobile screens like the iPhone5. Consider keeping your link text short, and if you run out of space on very small screens you can always swap out the text for icons using a CSS @media query.

Centered nav links aren't supported by default Bootstrap, so you'll have to add some CSS of your own to make that happen. See the following example: https://codepen.io/davidcochran/pen/rcHae

The same mobile horizontal space issue also applies to your About Me and Portfolio sections. I would consider placing the images on top of the text on the XS breakpoint so the paragraphs can have the full width of the phone screen - just to be on the safe side. I think this will also be easier to read.

Nice work here. Your Milestone 2a passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You are clear to begin development on your PWP. You'll want to build your PWP page in the following location: `public_html/index.php`, and the next Milestone will be a mid-development checkin.

## Milestone 2b Feedback
